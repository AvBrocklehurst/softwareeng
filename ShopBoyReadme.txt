SHOP BOY MODE
Song: I am the Music Man
Producer: Josh (aka the Music Man)

As requested the Shop Boy Mode plays a medley of tunes chosen to attract potential customers.
However instead of playing lots of little tunes our Simori plays an entire song that really shows off its capabilities to customers.
The song consists of 21 files, each played one after the other (forming a song).
The song it plays is a Simori version of the song Music Man:

Since the Simori can play anything it seems fitting to have a song with the same metaphor (after all is there anything the Music Man can't play?)
One a serious note this song shows off the full capabilities of the Simori:
	Multiple layers (up to 14 layers at one point)
	Multiple different instruments
	Multiple different percussion instruments
	Multiple notes at the same time
	Multiple pitches
	Multiple different loop speeds
	Multiple different loop points

So turn the Simori on, enter Shop Boy Mode and Sing Along!
