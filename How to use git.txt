Don't change the git ignore.

Instructions:

Install git
go to git shell or open cmd
first time: 

    make a folder in your documents called softwaredev and cd to it
  
    git clone https://github.com/Adhyun/softwaredev.git
  
     cd into the new subfolder
  
      make a new javaproject with the name softwaredev with the root folder as the softwaredev folder which is in the other software folder which is shared with .reccomenders (this should be the third softwaredev down (git makes sub folders very common lke this))
  

Made changes:

    in the directory navigated to as above.
  
    git add *
  
    git commit -a -m "message here"
  
    git push -u
  
  
If it says branch is not up to date or you are coming back after a while:

    git pull
  
  
If you want to create a new branch to make a big change without screwing the rest of us up:

    git branch newbranchname
  
    git checkout newbranchname
  
  
To switch branches:

     git checkout otherbranch
  
Never merge two branches, leave that for me when we have checked that there are no conflicts.
